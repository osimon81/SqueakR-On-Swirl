  Course: SqueakR On Swirl
  Lesson: Introduction
  Author: Simon Ogundare
  Type: Standard
  Organization: Columbia University
  Version: 2.4.5

- Class: text
  Output: Welcome to SqueakR on Swirl! This course is designed to equip researchers
    with an understanding of how the SqueakR suite can be used for research, data
    exploration, and analysis. SqueakR is officially a package which serves as an
    experiment interface for pre-processing, cleaning, and analyzing DeepSqueak data
    for bioacoustics research. However, SqueakR also loosely represents a suite of
    additional programs (like this Swirl course!) which can be used to supplement the
    main package.
    
- Class: text
  Output: While there is extensive documentation on how to use the package,
    most of which can be found online, this interactive course is designed with the
    novice R-user in mind. Working through how these functions work in an interactive
    manner will help users discover how to leverage the SqueakR suite for producing
    and running more efficient, organized, and reproducible experiments.

- Class: text
  Output: The primary functions for the SqueakR suite depend on the SqueakR package, which
    is published both on CRAN (the official repository for R packages) and GitHub.
    While there are many differences between CRAN and GitHub, there are a few key
    differences when considering which version of SqueakR to download.
    
- Class: text
  Output: (CRAN) Packages published on CRAN are subject to peer-review to ensure quality.
    The CRAN version of SqueakR is typically more stable, and may be a version or
    two behind GitHub's release. However, CRAN releases are unlikely to throw
    errors due to this. To install SqueakR from CRAN, type install.packages("SqueakR").
    
    
- Class: text
  Output: (GitHub) SqueakR is usually updated on GitHub more often, and as a result may
    temporarily have more features than CRAN releases, until these changes are
    pushed to CRAN as well. As a result, GitHub builds can be more experimental, and
    is slightly more likely to throw errors.
    
- Class: text
  Output: To install SqueakR from GitHub, type install_github("osimon81/SqueakR"). When
    this function is typically run, you would need to install the "devtools" library.
    But for this lesson, let's stick to CRAN.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Install SqueakR from CRAN in the console below...
  CorrectAnswer: install.packages("SqueakR")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='install.packages("SqueakR")')
  Hint: install.packages("PACKAGE NAME") is typically used to install CRAN packages.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Once the package is loaded, we'll want to load it into our workspace.
    This can be done using library(SqueakR). Let's run this function below...
  CorrectAnswer: library(SqueakR)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='library(SqueakR)')
  Hint: Use library(PACKAGE NAME) to load the package.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now that we've loaded SqueakR, we can learn more about it by calling
    '?SqueakR'. Later on, we can use the '?' operator to request documentation
    for unfamiliar functions, which will be loaded directly in R. Let's use
    this operator to pull up the description for SqueakR...
  CorrectAnswer: ?SqueakR
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='?SqueakR')
  Hint: Run `?SqueakR` in the console.
  
- Class: text
  Output: Let's look at another way of accessing documentation. When you're
    running experiments using SqueakR in the future, you'll want to figure out
    which version to download (the CRAN release or the GitHub release).

- Class: text
  Output: It can be helpful to first check out the changelog to figure out
    which features are available for a given release of SqueakR, so you can
    download the appropriate release for your experiment.
    
- Class: text
  Output: On the other hand, if you're somewhat daring, it's also helpful to
    check out the GitHub releases to help us check for bugs on our end!
    
- Class: video
  Output: The URL below links to the SqueakR website, which contains complete documentation
    on how to use the package, as well as the changelog. Feel free to read through
    this website, or use it as a reference while we work through the functions of
    this package.

- Class: text
  Output: Great job! You're almost there. Let's review what we've learned.
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: If you wanted to use a SqueakR release which had experimental features
    not yet available on the typical location for the stable release, where and
    how would you download that package?
  AnswerChoices: CRAN, install.packages();GitHub, install.packages();
    CRAN, install_github();GitHub, install_github()
  CorrectAnswer: GitHub, install_github()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='GitHub, install_github()')
  Hint: Where are you more likely to find experimental features?

- Class: text
  Output: You did great! Let's move on.
