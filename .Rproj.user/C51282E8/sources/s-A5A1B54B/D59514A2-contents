  Output: Welcome to SqueakR on Swirl! This course is designed to equip researchers
with an understanding of how the SqueakR suite can be used for research, data
exploration, and analysis.

SqueakR is officially a package which serves as an experiment interface for
pre-processing, cleaning, and analyzing DeepSqueak data for bioacoustics
projects. However, loosely, SqueakR also represents a suite of additional
programs (like this Swirl course!) which can be used to supplement the main
package.

While there is extensive documentation on how to use the package, most of which
can be found online, this interactive course is designed with the novice R-user
in mind. Working through how these functions work in an interactive manner will
help users discover how to leverage the SqueakR suite for producing and running
more efficient, more organized experiments.
